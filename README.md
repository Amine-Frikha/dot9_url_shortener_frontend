# Dot9 URL Shortener Documentation

## The Front-End
The frontend was developed using the react Javascript Library with the following dependencies : 
###  Axios
###  react-bootstrap
###  bootstrap
###  material-UI

## The Back-End The Back-End
The backend was developed using NodeJS with the following dependencies : 
###  Express
###  cors
###  mongoose
###  config
###  nanoid
###  valid-url

## Software Environment :
###  Microsoft Visual Studio Code

## Deployment :
It is important to mention that popular deployment options all have a fairly long base URL which reduces the efficiency of this app since it is a URL shortening app
I had no choice but to use one these popular options which is Heroku.
This app was deployed using the Git deployment method.
